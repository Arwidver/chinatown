               "Nobody can be a true hero unless he has been on the Great Wall" 
               goes the popular Chinese saying, one that clearly demonstrates 
               the importance placed upon this unique ancient monument.
                <br><br>
               The magnificent Great Wall of China - known in Chinese as 'Changcheng', 
               or the 'Long Wall' - stretches more than 6,000 kilometers from the 
               fortresses of Shanhaiguan in the east all the way to Jiayuguan 
               in the west, passing through Hebei, Tientsin, Beijing, where the 
               best preserved sections of the wall can be visited Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Gansu.

                China's largest and most important building, the Forbidden City (Zǐjìnchéng)
                also known as the Imperial Palace – is situated in the very heart of Beijing 
                and is a must-see when visiting the country. Started during the Yuan Dynasty between 1271-1368,
                much of the complex seen today was built between 1406 and 1420. Really many splendid 
                palaces in one, this sprawlinng complex was the residence of 24 Ming and Qing Emperors, 
                whose presence forbade the entry of anyone other than the imperial family and their courtesans.

                It was while digging wells on the outskirts of Xi'an in the 1970s that farmers stumbled across what was to be China's most important archeological find: the Terracotta Army. Distributed over three large underground pits and built to guard the First Emperor's tomb, the find included more than 8,000 life-size warriors, some 520 horses, and more than 100 chariots, along with numerous other non-military characters dating from around 280 BC.
